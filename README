NAME
    File::Path::Set - Return a set of files along a path

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    This module finds all readable files along a defined path, possibly
    stoping at a base path.

    This module mimics the behaviour of how apache searches for .htaccess
    files.

        use File::Path::Set;

        my $set = File::Path::Set->new(
            base => '/bar/baz',
            filename => 'config.inc'
        );
        $set->file_set('/bar/baz/quux/') 
            => (qw(/bar/baz/quux/config.inc /bar/baz/config.inc))

METHODS
  new()
    Returns a new File::Path::Set object. Only required parameter is
    filename. Other possible paramters are base, which is the last path to
    consider. It defaults to the rootdir ('/' on Unix). There is also a
    paramter names predicate that can be set to a sub routine, which will be
    called with every filename. The filenames are only returned if predicate
    return with a true value. If you do not set this, sub { -r $_[0] } is
    applied, so that only readable files will be returned.

  files($path)
    Returns an array of files along $path. The files are sorted with the
    shortest file path at the first position.
